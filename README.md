*** DESIGN
The idea for a parallax scrolling website came from my interest in old video game graphics technology, it was used to give the illusion of movement. I thaught that it would be a nice asthitic for a scrolling based website and give the user a reason to keep lookng through the site.
The color scheme was based off a promotional image for a video game called 'Fire Watch'.

The way that the 3d parallax was achieved was based off the code pen 
<CODEPEN LINK> by <CODE PEN AUTHOR, as well as the tutorial by <TUT AUTOHOR> <TUT LINK>. Then adpted for the images that i had created. Inspiration for the design came both from video game art that i liked as well as from my experience living the rocky mountains in canada. Much of thea art is based off photogrps that i took durng my ime there, and old adertisment material that I got form the area.
I looked a a few color schem gradients but fel that a sunset/autumn look worked best. For the fonts I trialed a few diffenet combinations, I kept the same font scheme for the entire website. I aslo tred to keep the colors consistent in both the page design and the art work.

Eventiually settling on <FNOT NAMES>

The site was designed with both mobile and large desktop and tablet displays in mind. The mobile site had a disaponting look in landscape mode, and required the site to be alsomost completly redesigned so I decied to only suport protait and show the user an mesage asking them to roate ther phone.
For the basic structure of the website i chose to used a single scrolled page rather than a a collection of smaller pages. I feel that, especialy on a phone , it is easier to scroll to find the information that you want rather than have to navigate throug a bunch o f hyerlinks. The site dies however have a navigation bar so that users ca junp to the sexion that they require imidietly. The navigation bar on the moble is a selciton of icons rather than the typical hamburger styled menu. this allows the user thp easily get the information tat they are loking for as well as setting it part from the calssic mobile desing.

The site was also designed to be upradealbe, the skills sections has secins left blank with placeholder divs to add segments for the skills we will learn duing the remainder of the course. I thproject section isalso expandable wihta  flexbox and card desing so that more projects can be added as they are completed during my time at Coder Adcademy.

The project was planed on trello

I tried ot split the tasks eavenly across all days to give my self a realiatic work scedual an dot allow time incase i came across problems when building the site. I also left one day with on schedualed tasks as a safty net incase i faced a major problem that slowed me down.
