*** DESIGN
The idea for a parallax scrolling website came from my interest in old video game graphics technology, it was used to give the illusion of movement. I thaught that it would be a nice asthitic for a scrolling based website and give the user a reason to keep lookng through the site.
The color scheme was based off a promotional image for a video game called 'Fire Watch'.

The way that the 3d parallax was achieved was based off the code pen 
<CODEPEN LINK> by <CODE PEN AUTHOR, as well as the tutorial by <TUT AUTOHOR> <TUT LINK>. Then adpted for the images that i had created. Inspiration for the design came both from video game are that i liked as well as from my experience living the rocky mountains in canada. Much of thea art is based off photogrps that i took durng my ime there.
I didnt try many differnet colorschemes as I wanted a sunset/autumn look and had found a gradient that worked. For the fonts I trialed a few diffenet combinations, I kept the same font schemw for the entire website. I aslo tred to keep the colors consistent in both the page design and the art work.

Eventiually settling on <FNOT NAMES>

The site was designed with both mobile and desktop in mind. The mobile site had a dissaponting look in landscape mode, so I decied to only suport protait and show the user a mesage to roate ther phone.
The basic structure of the website i chose to used a single scrolled page rather than a a collection of smaller pages. I feel that, especialy on a phone , it is easier to scroll to find the information that you wawnt rather than have to navigate throug a bunch o f hyerlinks. The site dies however have a navigation bar so that users ca junp to the sexion that they require imidietly. The navigation bar on the moble is a selciton of icons rather than the typicla hamburger styled menu. this allows the user thp easily get the information tat they are loking for.

The project was planed on trello

I tried ot split the tasks eavenly across all days to give my self a realiatic work scedual an dot allow time incase i came across problems when building the site. I also left one day with on schedualed tasks as a safty net incase i faced a major problem that slowed me down.
